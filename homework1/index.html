	<h2>MY MEMORY OF PIE</h2>
	<div id="story">
			I grew up with pie as a companion, when I was very young, pie is not just my favorite snack, but also my emotional placebo.
			In my childhood, my grandmother often took me to eat pieï¼Œespecially when I was in a bad mood. Pie is a good memory of my childhood. Every time I miss home, I will eat pie alone.
			The story is over.
